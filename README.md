- [First Come First Serve](./01_CPU_Scheduling/CpuScheduling.c)
- [Shortest Job First](./01_CPU_Scheduling/CpuScheduling.c)
- [Shortest Remaining Time First](./01_CPU_Scheduling/CpuScheduling.c)
- [Priority Non-Preemptive](./01_CPU_Scheduling/Cpu2.c)
- [Priority Preemptive](./01_CPU_Scheduling/Cpu2.c)
